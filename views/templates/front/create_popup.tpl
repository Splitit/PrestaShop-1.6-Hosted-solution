Any claim, dispute or controversy ("Claim") arising from or connected with this Agreement, including the enforceability, validity or scope of this arbitration clause or this Agreement, shall be governed by this provision.

Any arbitration hearing shall take place within the State of New York, County of New York. At the written request of Buyer, any filing and administrative fees charged or assessed by the AAA which are required to be paid by Buyer and that are in excess of any filing fee Buyer would have been required to pay to file a Claim in state court in New York shall be advanced and paid for by Seller. The arbitrator may not award punitive or exemplary damages against any party.

This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the FAA, and, if and where applicable, the internal laws of the State of New York. If any portion of this Arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration provision or the Agreement, provided however, if the Class Action Waiver is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration provision shall be null and void and of no force or effect, but the remaining terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
